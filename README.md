# Uncommon JavaScript Error: Unexpected token in JSON response

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in JavaScript applications when handling JSON responses.  The error, "Unexpected token", often arises from inconsistencies between the expected JSON structure and the actual response received from an API or other source.

## Scenario

The `calculator.js` file contains a simple calculator implementation.  While not directly related to JSON handling, it serves as a foundation for demonstrating the error in a practical context.

The issue arises when a malformed JSON response is received, resulting in an unexpected token during parsing. This example is designed to demonstrate the problem and its solution in a controlled environment.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the code in a suitable JavaScript environment (Node.js). 
3. Attempt to parse the JSON response; this will lead to the unexpected token error if the JSON is malformed.

## Solution

The `calculatorSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that avoids the issue. It demonstrates robust error handling to gracefully manage malformed JSON. This robust error handling is key to avoiding crashes and improving application reliability.
